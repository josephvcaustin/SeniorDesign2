A repository for all code related to the 2017 Senior Design 2 Challenge at Oklahoma State University: the development of a competition robot for the Mercury Robotics 2017 Challenge.

Refer to the Mercury Competition Manual for a detailed description of the competition, and refer to the Final Report for an extensive report of the robot my team and I engineered for the competition.
